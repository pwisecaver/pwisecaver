Hi, I’m @pwisecaver

## Motivation for this document

If you've showed up here, there is a good chance you are looking to learns something about me. The purpose of this document it to help you learn about who i am and how i work. We all appreciate good clear documentation from time to time. This is my humble attempt to provide that - the readme of pwisecaver!

Note: this document is (and will always be) under construction.

## Who i am

In one context, i'm a manager - though i often see that title as a misnomer. If you report to me, a large part of my job is to serve you. I want you to be a successful human being both in and out of the workplace. This is how we achieve our maximal sustainable potential - and when you are at that level, i am right there beside you.

Really this requires a number of roles to fulfill:
- **Mentor:** i can't tell you what you want, but i can certainly help you find ways to get there.
- **Advocate:** good ideas and good deeds need to be noted and celebrated, and in all areas perspective and understanding needs to be strived for.
- **Feedback Facilitator:** honesty builds trust and helps us grow - and this goes in all directions. We should not be blind to our faults - and this goes doubly so for our strengths.
- **Roadblock Remover:** some struggle in problem solving is healthy, but when progress is obstructed i'm here to figure out how to go over, under, around or through.
- **Translator:** effective communication and alignment is about helping others to create the same mental images. We may all speak the same language but we don't all use it the same.
- **Listener:** i can't understand if i don't listen. Sometimes the presence of a sounding board is all that's needed - and i'm glad to give that too.
- **Comrade:** i will show my support by fighting in the trenches alongside you.
- **Example:** true leadership comes from embodying the same principles you desire from others

This isn't restricted to a specific team affiliation or rank either - everyone deserves this and it's important to help this to not go overlooked whenever possible. We should all try to do this for each other

## My values

Communication and transparency can sometimes be a bit tricky to navigate, but it is very much needed to maintain trust and effective collaboration. I'm a firm believer that we can do more together than we can on our own - but that doesn't come from just working on the same things together. The most effective collaboration is built on strong interpersonal relationships.

I value:
- **Harmony:** harmony does not mean constant agreement - a team that trusts each other can disagree openly. Harmony comes from treating each other with care and respect.
- **Honesty:** honest builds trust and demonstrates interest beyond the self. It is OK to not know, and it is also valuable to correct misinformation.
- **Empathy:** we all have different perspectives and feelings - and regardless of if we agree, we should always strive to understand.
- **Dependability:** a team needs to rely on each other to collectively succeed.
- **Learning:** individual growth impacts every level of an organization. There is no such thing as a failure when mistakes are learning opportunities.


## What you can expect from me

I beleive we should all give our respect freely. One can lose respect from poor behavior and may be able to earn it back. You can and should expect that I will show respect for you - and that I will do everything I can to ensure that you are in a respectful and safe environment. That respect manifests in the following ways:
- I will listen to your ideas.
- I will endever to honor your emotions when they surface.
- I will work to ensure you have what you need to be set up to succeed.
- I will not micromanage you.
- I will be honest with you.

## My flaws (that i'm aware of)
I generally have to have things on my calendar for them to happen. I'm mostly good at calendaring and confirming - but if i don't Murphy's law dictates i will be double-booked.

In conversations i sometimes stare off to the infinite - possibly to a point a million miles behind your head. I'm almost always still listening and an idea from something you've said has captivated me. Likely you've inspired a connection and i'm chasing it down in my own private universe. Sometimes it will be brilliant insight i can give back to you in the moment. Sometimes i won't be able to articulate the connection - but will likely resurface as a full idea. Sometimes i have indigestion.

I'm a dreamer and i dream big. When i see what is possible, i will also see how to get there. Usually i am good at realizing when the value warrants the effort. Admittedly sometimes value is in the eyes of the beholder.

## What I expect from you

Conscientious action is what respect looks like in the wild.  I expect you to be respectful of those on your team, those on other teams, our users, our potential users...I think you get the picture. What do some of those actions look like?
- **Never throw a teammate under the bus**. They need to trust you and you need to trust them. If you have a disagreement, discreetly talk to them. If that doesn’t work, both of you should discreetly talk to me together.
- **You represent your team** to the rest of the world. Don’t make us look bad. Foster respect and good will among other teams and users.
- **Be on time**. Don’t mismanage your time at the expense of others.
- **Be transparent**. If you are struggling with anything, even if you are having personal issues, I need to be aware of how this might impact your work so I can plan around it. There is no danger in over-communicating but a lack of communication raises a lot of red flags for me.
- **Challenge me**. If I’m on the wrong path, I need to know it.
- **Treat the production environment as a holy thing**. Our users need to trust the systems we create. Don’t ship broken code in order to meet a deadline. If you find a bug in production, take ownership of it by fixing it and/or filing a ticket.
- **Speak up**. Your opinions matter.
- **Take chances and try new things**. In tech, complacency is death.
- **Maintain a healthy work/life balance**. The idea that you have to work 60+ hour weeks in tech is misguided. Working more hours just becomes a justification to be less efficient. I would much prefer you are sharp and focussed 35 hours a week than a zombie that works 70 hours a week.
- **Actively practice empathy**. A little goes a long way.
- **Ceremony is essential to community**. Even if you don’t feel you are benefitting from daily standups, know that the team benefits for all of us participating. Show up for your community.

## How to get under my skin
Likely important to know how to rub me the wrong way as well. I will always be as forgiving as i can be, but that comes with limits.
- Overtly lying for your own self interest. 
- Damaging the team.
- Damaging the product.
